## Abstract

CIP stands for Celestia Improvement Proposal. A CIP is a design document providing information to the Celestia community, or describing a new feature for Celestia or its processes or environment. The CIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The CIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

This CIP describes the recommended process for becoming an CIP editor.

## Specification

### Application and Onboarding Process

Anyone having a good understanding of the CIP standardization and network upgrade process, intermediate level experience on the core side of the Celestia blockchain, and willingness to contribute to the process management may apply to become a CIP editor. Potential CIP editors should have the following skills:

- Good communication skills
- Ability to handle contentious discourse
- 1-5 spare hours per week
- Ability to understand "rough consensus"

The best available resource to understand the CIP process is [CIP-1](./cip-1.md). Anyone desirous of becoming an CIP editor MUST understand this document. Afterwards, participating in the CIP process by commenting on and suggesting improvements to PRs and issues will familliarize the procedure, and is recommended. The contributions of newer editors should be monitored by other CIP editors.

Anyone meeting the above requirements may make a pull request adding themselves as an CIP editor and adding themselves to the editor list in [CIP-1](./cip-1.md). If every existing CIP editor approves, the author becomes a full CIP editor. This should notify the editor of relevant new proposals submitted in the CIPs repository, and they should review and merge those pull requests.
