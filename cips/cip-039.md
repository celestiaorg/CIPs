## Abstract

Currently, the state machine has a token filter which restricts the creation of non-native assets on it for both Hyperlane and IBC. This means that any asset other than TIA cannot be bridged to Celestia via its currently supported interoperability protocols: Hyperlane and IBC. This CIP proposes removing this token filter to allow any asset to be bridged to Celestia.

## Motivation

Currently, restricting token creation to only TIA on the state machine prevents Celestia from serving as an effective routing layer for cross-chain assets that have demand by Celestia-native applications. Removing this restriction lets Celestia-native applications to access any asset on any application also connected to Celestia by just making a connection to Celestia themselves. This lets Celestia serve as an effective routing layer for various assets to Celestia-native applications.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

To disable the token filter for Hyperlane, the WarpKeeper configuration MUST be modified to include synthetic token support by adding the `HYP_TOKEN_TYPE_SYNTHETIC` token type to the allowed token types array.

**Current Configuration:**
```go
app.WarpKeeper = warpkeeper.NewKeeper(
    encodingConfig.Codec,
    encodingConfig.AddressCodec,
    runtime.NewKVStoreService(keys[warptypes.ModuleName]),
    govModuleAddr,
    app.BankKeeper,
    &app.HyperlaneKeeper,
    []int32{int32(warptypes.HYP_TOKEN_TYPE_COLLATERAL)}, // Only collateral tokens
)
```

**Updated Configuration:**
```go
app.WarpKeeper = warpkeeper.NewKeeper(
    encodingConfig.Codec,
    encodingConfig.AddressCodec,
    runtime.NewKVStoreService(keys[warptypes.ModuleName]),
    govModuleAddr,
    app.BankKeeper,
    &app.HyperlaneKeeper,
    []int32{int32(warptypes.HYP_TOKEN_TYPE_COLLATERAL), int32(warptypes.HYP_TOKEN_TYPE_SYNTHETIC)}, // Add synthetic tokens
)
```

To have similar functionality for IBC, the IBC token filter that prevents non-TIA tokens from being transferred via IBC MUST be removed to allow non-TIA assets to flow through IBC channels.

This token filter implementation that currently exists in [`app/app.go` at line 357](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/c1f2a4c5c773f20c25043f98f4b8759b603ce825/app/app.go#L357).

## Parameters

This CIP does not introduce new parameters but modifies the existing Hyperlane and IBC implementations to disable the token filter.

## Rationale

The implementation requires only small modifications to the WarpKeeper configuration and removal of the IBC token filter, minimizing the risk of introducing bugs.

## Backwards Compatibility

This CIP is backward compatible. Existing functionality with moving around TIA will remain unchanged. The addition of non-TIA assets is purely additive and does not affect existing users or applications.

No existing APIs, interfaces, or behaviors are modified - only new functionality is added.

## Test Cases

### Synthetic Token Creation Test

- Transfer a non-TIA asset through Hyperlane to Celestia
- Verify the token appears in Celestia's state
- Confirm token can be transferred via IBC to another chain

### IBC Transfer Test

- Transfer a non-TIA asset through IBC to Celestia
- Verify the token appears in Celestia's state
- Transfer the token to another chain via Hyperlane

### Backward Compatibility Test

- Ensure existing token functionality with TIA remains unchanged
- Verify TIA transfers continue to work as expected
- Confirm no regression in existing Hyperlane functionality

## Security Considerations

### Synthetic Token Risks
- **Token Validation**: Synthetic tokens must be properly validated through the Hyperlane integration to prevent malicious token creation
- **Supply Management**: Synthetic tokens should have proper supply controls to prevent inflation attacks
- **Cross-Chain Verification**: The underlying assets backing synthetic tokens must be properly verified on the origin chain

### IBC Security
- **Channel Security**: Removing the token filter increases the attack surface for IBC channels. Proper channel validation and monitoring are essential
- **Asset Verification**: Without token filtering, additional validation mechanisms may be needed to ensure asset legitimacy

### Mitigation Strategies
- Leverage existing Hyperlane security mechanisms for token validation
- Implement proper monitoring and alerting for synthetic token operations
- Ensure thorough testing of cross-chain token transfers
- Consider implementing rate limiting for synthetic token operations if needed

### Audit Recommendations
- Security audit of the WarpKeeper configuration changes
- Review of IBC token filter removal implications
- Testing of synthetic token creation and transfer flows
- Validation of cross-chain security mechanisms
