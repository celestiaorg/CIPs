## Abstract

Currently, the state machine has a token filter which restricts the creation of non-native assets on it for both Hyperlane and IBC. This means that any asset other than TIA cannot be bridged to Celestia via its currently supported interoperability protocols: Hyperlane and IBC. This CIP proposes removing this token filter to allow any asset to be bridged to Celestia.

## Motivation

Currently, restricting token creation to only TIA on the state machine prevents Celestia from serving as an effective routing layer for cross-chain assets that have demand by Celestia-native applications. Removing this restriction lets Celestia-native applications to access any asset on any application also connected to Celestia by just making a connection to Celestia themselves. This lets Celestia serve as an effective routing layer for various assets to Celestia-native applications.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

To disable the token filter for Hyperlane, the WarpKeeper configuration MUST be modified to include synthetic token support by adding the `HYP_TOKEN_TYPE_SYNTHETIC` token type to the allowed token types array.

**Current Configuration:**

```go
app.WarpKeeper = warpkeeper.NewKeeper(
    encodingConfig.Codec,
    encodingConfig.AddressCodec,
    runtime.NewKVStoreService(keys[warptypes.ModuleName]),
    govModuleAddr,
    app.BankKeeper,
    &app.HyperlaneKeeper,
    []int32{int32(warptypes.HYP_TOKEN_TYPE_COLLATERAL)}, // Only collateral tokens
)
```

**Updated Configuration:**

```go
app.WarpKeeper = warpkeeper.NewKeeper(
    encodingConfig.Codec,
    encodingConfig.AddressCodec,
    runtime.NewKVStoreService(keys[warptypes.ModuleName]),
    govModuleAddr,
    app.BankKeeper,
    &app.HyperlaneKeeper,
    []int32{int32(warptypes.HYP_TOKEN_TYPE_COLLATERAL), int32(warptypes.HYP_TOKEN_TYPE_SYNTHETIC)}, // Add synthetic tokens
)
```

To have similar functionality for IBC, the IBC token filter that prevents non-TIA tokens from being transferred via IBC MUST be removed to allow non-TIA assets to flow through IBC channels.

This token filter implementation that currently exists in [`app/app.go` at line 357](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/c1f2a4c5c773f20c25043f98f4b8759b603ce825/app/app.go#L357).

## Parameters

This CIP does not introduce new parameters but modifies the existing Hyperlane and IBC implementations to disable the token filter.

## Rationale

The implementation requires only small modifications to the WarpKeeper configuration and removal of the IBC token filter, minimizing the risk of introducing bugs.

## Backwards Compatibility

This CIP is backward compatible. Existing functionality with moving around TIA will remain unchanged. The addition of non-TIA assets is purely additive and does not affect existing users or applications.

No existing APIs, interfaces, or behaviors are modified - only new functionality is added.

## Test Cases

- An E2E test that transfers a non-TIA asset via IBC from an IBC-enabled chain like Osmosis to Celestia Transfer. Verify the token appears in Celestia's state machine. Confirm token can be transferred via IBC to the same chain and also another IBC-enabled chain.
- The same test as above with Hyperlane from/to a Hyperlane-enabled chain.

### Backward Compatibility

- Verify TIA transfers continue to work as expected
- Confirm no regression in existing Hyperlane and IBC functionality

## Security Considerations

Removing the token filter for Hyperlane and IBC introduces several security risks that must be carefully managed:

### Primary Risk Categories

**Malicious Token Introduction**: Arbitrary tokens can be bridged to Celestia, enabling spam tokens, malicious contracts, and potential rug pulls. Attackers could create worthless tokens to clog the network or deceive users with misleading metadata.

**Network Resource Exhaustion**: Unlimited token types may lead to state bloat, transaction spam, and bridge congestion. Large volumes of worthless tokens could consume bridge liquidity and manipulate fee markets.

### Risk Assessment

These risks are consistent with other multi-chain ecosystems. The proposal's additive nature preserves existing TIA security while introducing risks primarily for users who choose to interact with bridged tokens.
