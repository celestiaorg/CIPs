## Abstract

This Meta CIP lists the CIPs included in the Matcha network upgrade.

## Specification

### Included CIPs

- [CIP-36](./cip-036.md): Lowering Trusting Period to 7 Days
- [CIP-37](./cip-037.md): Lower unbonding period to ~14 days
- [CIP-38](./cip-038.md): Increase maximum block, square and transaction size
- [CIP-39](./cip-039.md): Remove token filter for Hyperlane and IBC
- [CIP-40](./cip-040.md): Privval Interface Extension for Arbitrary Message Signing
- [CIP-41](./cip-041.md): Reduce issuance to 2.5% and increase minimum commission to 10%

All of the above CIPs are state breaking, and thus require a breaking network upgrade.

## Rationale

This CIP provides a complete list of breaking changes for the Matcha upgrade, along with links to those specs.

## Security Considerations

This CIP does not have additional security concerns beyond what is already discussed in each of the listed specs.
