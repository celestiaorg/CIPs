## Abstract

This Meta CIP lists the CIPs included in the Lemongrass network upgrade.

## Specification

### Included CIPs

- [CIP-6](https://github.com/celestiaorg/CIPs/blob/main/cips/cip-6.md): Price Enforcement
- [CIP-9](https://github.com/celestiaorg/CIPs/blob/main/cips/cip-9.md): Packet Forward Middleware
- [CIP-10](https://github.com/celestiaorg/CIPs/blob/main/cips/cip-10.md): Coordinated Upgrades
- [CIP-14](https://github.com/celestiaorg/CIPs/blob/main/cips/cip-14.md): Interchain Accounts
- [CIP-20](https://github.com/celestiaorg/CIPs/blob/main/cips/cip-20.md): Disable Blobstream module

All of the above CIPs are state breaking, and thus require a hardfork. The activation of this hardfork will be different from future hardforks, as described in [CIP-10](https://github.com/celestiaorg/CIPs/blob/main/cips/cip-10.md).

## Rationale

This CIP provides a complete list of breaking changes for the Lemongrass upgrade, along with links to those specs.

## Security Considerations

This CIP does not have additional security concerns beyond what is already discussed in each of the listed specs.
