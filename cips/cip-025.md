## Abstract

This Meta CIP lists the CIPs included in the Ginger network upgrade.

## Specification

### Included CIPs

- [CIP-21](./cip-021.md): Introduce blob type with verified signer
- [CIP-24](./cip-024.md): Versioned Gas Scheduler Variables
- [CIP-26](./cip-026.md): Versioned timeouts
- [CIP-27](./cip-027.md): Block limits for number of PFBs and non-PFBs
- [CIP-28](./cip-028.md): Transaction size limit

All of the above CIPs are state breaking, and thus require a breaking network upgrade. The activation of this network upgrade will be different from previous network upgrades, as described in [CIP-10](./cip-010.md).

## Rationale

This CIP provides a complete list of breaking changes for the Ginger upgrade, along with links to those CIPs.

## Security Considerations

This CIP does not have additional security concerns beyond what is already discussed in each of the listed CIPs.
