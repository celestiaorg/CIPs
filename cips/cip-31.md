## Abstract

We propose adding Hyperlane functionality to celestia-app, either through whitelisted cosmWASM, through the Hyperlane cosmos-sdk module, or some other way.

## Motivation

Hyperlane is a popular bridging protocol for the TIA token. Currently, users have to take inconvenient and indirect routes through other chains to use Hyperlane, since Celestia does not include it natively.
