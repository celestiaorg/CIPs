## Abstract

This Meta CIP lists the CIPs included in the Lemongrass network upgrade.

## Specification

### Included CIPs

- [CIP-6](./cip-006.md): Price Enforcement
- [CIP-9](./cip-009.md): Packet Forward Middleware
- [CIP-10](./cip-010.md): Coordinated Upgrades
- [CIP-14](./cip-014.md): Interchain Accounts
- [CIP-20](./cip-020.md): Disable Blobstream module

All of the above CIPs are state breaking, and thus require a breaking network upgrade. The activation of this network upgrade will be different from future network upgrades, as described in [CIP-10](./cip-010.md).

## Rationale

This CIP provides a complete list of breaking changes for the Lemongrass upgrade, along with links to those specs.

## Security Considerations

This CIP does not have additional security concerns beyond what is already discussed in each of the listed specs.
