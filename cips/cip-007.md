## Abstract

This document provides a detailed guide for managing working groups within the Celestia Improvement Proposal (CIP) process. It draws from best practices in organizations like the IETF, focusing on the formation, management, and closure of working groups, ensuring their alignment with the overarching goals of the Celestia network.

## Motivation

The successful implementation of the CIP process requires a structured approach to managing working groups. These groups are pivotal in addressing various aspects of Celestia’s core protocol and ecosystem. Effective management ensures collaborative progress and helps align group outputs with Celestia's broader objectives.

## Specification

### 1. Formation of Working Groups

- Identify key areas needing attention.
- Announce formation and invite participation.
- Appoint chairs or leaders.

### 2. Defining Scope and Goals

- Draft a charter for each group.
- Set realistic and measurable goals.

### 3. Establishing Procedures

- Decide on a consensus process (e.g. rough consensus)
- Schedule regular meetings.
- Implement documentation and reporting systems for each meeting.

### 4. Collaboration and Communication

- Utilize tools like GitHub, Slack, Telegram and video conferencing.
- Foster an environment of open communication.

### 5. Conflict Resolution

- Establish a conflict resolution mechanism.
- Define the role of chairs in conflict management.

### 6. Review and Adaptation

- Regularly review progress.
- Adapt scope or processes as needed.

### 7. Integration with the Larger Process

- Ensure alignment with the overall CIP process.
- Create a feedback loop with the community.

### 8. Closure

- Define criteria for completion.
- Document and share outcomes.
- Conduct a retrospective.

## Rationale

The rationale for this approach is based on established practices in standardization bodies. By applying these methods, Celestia can ensure that its working groups are productive, inclusive, and effectively contribute to the network’s development.

## Security Considerations

The management of working groups primarily involves process and communication security. Ensuring transparent and secure communication channels and documenting management practices is essential.
