## Abstract

This Meta CIP lists the CIPs included in the Lotus network upgrade.

## Specification

### Included CIPs

- [CIP-29](./cip-029.md): Decrease inflation and disinflation
- [CIP-30](./cip-030.md): Disable auto-claim of staking rewards
- [CIP-31](./cip-031.md): Incorporate staking rewards into vesting account schedules
- [CIP-32](./cip-032.md): Add Hyperlane to Celestia

All of the above CIPs are state breaking, and thus require a breaking network upgrade.

## Rationale

This CIP provides a complete list of breaking changes for the Lotus upgrade, along with links to those specs.

## Security Considerations

This CIP does not have additional security concerns beyond what is already discussed in each of the listed specs.
