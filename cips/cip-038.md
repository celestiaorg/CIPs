## Abstract

This CIP specifies a high-throughput block recovery mechanism that uses pull-based broadcast trees to efficiently distribute block data across consensus nodes. The specification is maintained externally and this CIP serves as a formal reference to that specification.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

The complete specification for the high-throughput block recovery mechanism is being reviewed at:
https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/353f21116b2edb2b22df454df907567b50558b07/specs/src/recovery.md

Implementations MUST follow the specification as defined in the referenced document.

## Rationale

Celestia currently relies on full replication of block data across all validators before voting. The protocol described in the spec does this.

## Backwards Compatibility

No backward compatibility issues found.

## Security Considerations

The referenced specification includes comprehensive security considerations for defending against sybil attacks and denial-of-service attacks, even when combining pull based logic with broadcast tree logic.
