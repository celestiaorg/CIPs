## Abstract

This CIP proposes to set the minimum `MinimumPruningWindow` for Celestia nodes to 7 days + 1 hour (169 hours). This change is intended to complement CIP-036, which is expected to define a 7-day `SamplingWindow`. A pruning window of 7 days + 1 hour ensures that nodes can serve data for the entire sampling period. This adjustment aims to reduce storage requirements for node operators while maintaining data availability for light clients.

## Parameters

| Parameter     | Current value | Proposed value | Description                                                    |
|---------------|---------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| MinimumPruningWindow | 721 hours     | 169 hours      | The minimum retention period of block data for serving the network (nodes can set higher values) |

## Rationale

The next pending increase in throughput (32 MB blocks every 6 seconds) would require bridge nodes to store up to 1 TB per day. The current pruning window (30 days) implies that pruned bridge nodes need to have 30 TB of storage. This CIP reduces the pruning window to 7 days + 1 hour to reduce the storage requirement to 7 TB which makes it less costly to serve data to the network.

This CIP focuses solely on the `MinimumPruningWindow`. The rationale and specification for the 7-day `SamplingWindow` itself are detailed in CIP-036.

## Backwards Compatibility

This CIP's proposed change to the `MinimumPruningWindow` should be implemented *after* the changes specified in CIP-036 (which defines the 7-day `SamplingWindow`) are adopted by the network. Nodes must first support the new `SamplingWindow` before the `MinimumPruningWindow` is reduced to 7 days + 1 hour to ensure light nodes don't sample correctly pruned data.
