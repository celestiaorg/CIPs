## Abstract

This document details the roles and responsibilities of working group chairs in the Celestia Improvement Proposal (CIP) process. Inspired by best practices in standardization processes like Ethereum's EIP and the IETF, it provides a comprehensive guide on chair duties ranging from facilitation of discussions to conflict resolution.

## Motivation

Effective leadership within working groups is crucial for the success of the CIP process. Chairs play a pivotal role in guiding discussions, driving consensus, and ensuring that the groups' efforts align with Celestia's broader goals. This document aims to establish clear guidelines for these roles to enhance the efficiency and productivity of the working groups.

## Specification

### Roles of Working Group Chairs

- **Facilitate Discussions**: Chairs should ensure productive, focused, and inclusive meetings.
- **Drive Consensus**: Guide the group towards consensus and make decisions when necessary.
- **Administrative Responsibilities**: Oversee meeting scheduling, agenda setting, and record-keeping.
- **Communication Liaison**: Act as a bridge between the working group and the wider community, ensuring transparency and effective communication.
- **Guide Work Forward**: Monitor progress and address challenges, keeping the group on track with its goals.
- **Ensure Adherence to Process**: Uphold the established CIP process and guide members in following it.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Actively manage and resolve conflicts within the group.
- **Reporting and Accountability**: Provide regular reports on progress and be accountable for the group's achievements.

## Rationale

Drawing inspiration from established practices in bodies like the IETF and Ethereum's EIP, this proposal aims to create a structured and effective approach to managing working groups in Celestia. Clear definition of chair roles will facilitate smoother operation, better decision-making, and enhanced collaboration within the groups.

## Security Considerations

The primary security considerations involve maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of discussions and decisions made within the working groups. Chairs should ensure secure communication channels and safeguard sensitive information related to the group's activities.
